                <a href="https://rinatm01.github.io/Flexbox/">Simple Flexbox Layout (without Bootstrap)</a>
                <p>After learning most of the front-end fundamentals and using bootstrap library I decided to create a
                    simple one page layout without any help from bootstrap and using only native css flex-box property
                    that I heard is one of the most important concept in web design.</p>
                <p>The goal of this project was to practice building simple websites using flex-box properties and being
                    more independent from using bootstrap, as current web development trends suggets having as less
                    dependencies on extrnal libraries/frameworks as possible. To make the project more challanging
                    I recreated paralax background image effect and made the site responsive for various screen sizes.

                <p>After learning basics of the JavaScript programming language and a lot of practices, as a part of the
                    online course that I had been on, I built a simple entertaining web app project called "The Great
                    Color Game".</p>
                <p>Using front-end JavaScript this game creates 3 to 6 random rgb colors, randomly chooses one of the
                    colors to be the guessing color and displays all 3 or 6 colors in front of the user. Then based on
                    the given RGB code the user is supposed to guess the color. This game has two difficulties: hard ans
                    easy with 3 and 6 colors to guess respectively. As a matter of fact this game also helps to
                    practice recognition and understanding of RGB color code.</p>

                <p>Going deeper into learning JavaScript I started looking at different intersting JavaScript libraries.
                    To be able to effecrively ubderstanding their documentations and applying them in actual projects, I
                    started Patatap Clone Project. "Patatap" is existing web application that plays flashy animations
                    and sounds on each key press.
                </p>
                <p>In this project I had similar idea, however the animation part is simplified to just shrinking
                    colorful circles, because I don't have suffcient skills in animation. I used Paper.js library to
                    create animated circles on black canvas and Howler.js to play different sound for each different key
                    press. To try this project simply click on preview image or title and press any keys on your
                    keyboard.</p>

                <p>As the school that I study at was going to host the CAVC event (centralasian volleyball tournament),
                    I ,also as a member of our school's Tech Council, volunteered to create a website for score keeping,
                    as I saw in it the opportunity to apply my web development skills.
                </p>
                <p>Due to constricted time and the fact that I worked on this project alone, I decided to use bootstrap
                    to make the process of developing faster and easier. To make it more convinient and accessable I
                    made the website responsive to various screnn sizes, including desctop, tablet and mobile. </p>
